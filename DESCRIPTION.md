# PHOTO TRIPS

Photo trips is a web app that allows you to upload a group of images and using the meta data of the photos, will automatically produce a plotted out google map with your trip rendered on it, along with all the photos you have taken.

Allows you to edit any of the details of the photos + add new ones, add descriptions to what you saw / what you were doing at the time.
